## Analysis Findings:

- With a sample size of 892 results (438 long, and 454 short), my script correctly predicts if the next day's close will be higher or lower:
  - 78.31 % of the time for long positions.
  - 74.45 % of the time for short positions.
  - 76.34 % overall.

- For long positions but not short positions, the probability increases with the number of prior hits for a result.

- 1-hit results are still 76% predictive, so they should not be dismissed.

- Since the probability is close for both long and short positions, these results are likely not confounded by the bull market.


## Default Config

```
node nodeVSA "signal.recentHitsOnGreaterVolumeCount === signal.recentHitsCount && signal.recentHitsCount > 0 && signal.absorptionVolume === true && signal.belowAvgVol === true && signal.allRecentHitsDecreasing === true && signal.date === '2017-07-06' && signal.outerPivotOnLowerVolume === true"
```

## Lessons learned:
  - If you're getting no results, double check the names of your search criteria variables.
  - After 503 Maintenance, I was getting no results, without getting "no results" message. This conditional wasn't executing. It turns out that the problem was an escape backslash in the CL argument. I took out all slashes and it worked fine.
  - If there isn't enough historical data for a particular date, it will print "No results." This could be updated to check the data first.
  - If you need OHLCV data for the day of the signal, it's in signal.data.open, signal.data.close, etc.
  - If you're getting random "TypeError - Reduce called with initial empty array", it's because the service is randomly sending back empty request bodies. I have checked this against older commits, and it's them, not me.


## SPY Hypothesis:

  Major movements of SPY consistently correlates with extreme long:short ratios on the preceding day.
  
  Idea: create a ratio score, which takes into account multiple pivots at same level

  Disproven. Tracked this in a spreadsheet, and the correlation between script results and next-day SPY performance was 0.2539. Minimum critical value for the degrees of freedom is 0.337, for there to be less than a 1 in 10 chance the correlation is totally due to chance.

  In fact, I stupidly bet 20% of my capital on this hypothesis, right as the market had a correction. I cut my losses, but lesson learned. No correlation, and keep your positions to 10%.

## Future Analysis

I'd like to add a flag for "current day is a higher/lower high/low, on lower volume," and then perform a probabilistic analysis for that signal. I'm guessing it would jump up to 85% predictive or so.

### Analysis including 0-hit days

I am finding the same probability of predicting the next day's close with 0 hits as I found with 1, 2, 3+ hits. Approximately 75% no matter what. 

Initially, I was disappointed that this was just the market performance; thinking the market just went up ~75% of the time. However, when I checked short positions, they matched the same ~75%, but in the opposite direction. Short results, including 0-hit results, go down the next day 75% of the time. Huh?

This makes me believe that I am not testing the baseline I thought I was. I intended to compare to market performance overall, but instead I am comparing to *pivots* specifically. My program's results consist exclusively of pivot highs and lows. I believe that what I have found is that a pivot will be a true pivot ~75% of the time. ~25 of the time it will develop into a new trend.

What I need in order to find the true comparison I initially sought, is a set of data for all days for all stocks: closing price and next day's close. I then need to run the overall probability that the next day's close will be higher or lower. I guess this will be approximately 50%, but skewed towards higher closes as we have been in a bull market.

What this will prove, I think, is that pivots are more likely to predict the next close than random chance. Is this even useful?

I think so. It would still prove or disprove a trading edge, and calculating the random average % overnight change would be useful as well. Both would be useful.

1. Get daily stock data for all the S and P 500 stocks: Ticker, Date, Close, Next Close
2. Import to spreadsheet.
3. 


## Forward-looking

I've just noticed that results from last Friday have changed (I'm checking them again on Monday). 8-18-17, and IDXX is no longer listed as a result. I don't believe I've changed anything. I think this is caused by the conditional in markAllPivots, where a pivot is defined as being lower than both the preceding day and the following day. If there is no following day, it only looks at the preceding day. I believe that when a new day is printed, it retroactively erases some results. 

My backtesting bakes in forward-looking information. For the historical trade set, all trades that went the wrong way (turning into a new countertrend rather than a pivot) have been removed because they no longer fit the definition of a pivot. If I expect the same success rate of the daily results, I will be wrong.

The way to test is to track results day-by-day.

22 results were retroactively removed.

## Adding scan for a higher high on lower volume

I want to have the ability to scan for stocks where a pivot is higher but the volume is lower.
I already have a value for allRecentHitsDecreasing.
If this value is true, then I know the current pivot has lower volume.
I just need to add a check for:
  allRecentHitsDecreasing === true && pivotsArr[i]['h'] > {prior pivot}['h']



## Float analysis:

Complete turnovers of a ticker's floating shares, when calculated from a price extreme, often line up exactly dead on with major pivots. It's quite uncanny.

I wonder whether there is some other indicator I can check to see whether a turnover will result in a major price move, or whether it will be a 'nothing' turnover.









1. Get a stable source of floating shares. (Look at scraping Yahoo Finance),
2. Each day, run a script that:
  - retrieves this total float for each stock (how often does it really change?)
  - retrieves stock data for each stock.
  - identifies the last major pivot for each stock.
  - starts calculating float turnover from that pivot for that stock.
  - generates a list of stocks with 96+% turnover.
  - scans for recent outer pivots on lower volume.
  - returns a list of any stock approaching 100% turnover that also has an outer pivot on lower volume.
  - sends a text message to me with the results at 12:30pm.
3. Place trades,
